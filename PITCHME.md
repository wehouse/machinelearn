#### Anaconda Distributions
* Anaconda: 150 packages in total, roughly 3GB in download. Great for offline use-cases.
* Miniconda: Only absolute needed libraries to run conda and environment. Great for online and expert users.

- Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter/Spyder are available in both.

---
#### Numpy
* NumPy is a Python C extension library for array-oriented computing
  * Efficient
  * In-Memory
  * Contiguous (or Strided)
  * Homogeneous (but types can be algebraic)

**Numby is the foundation of python scientific stack**
